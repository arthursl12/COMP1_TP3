Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

term (12)
    on left: 1 2


state 0

    INT_CONSTANT	shift, and go to state 1
    IDENTIFIER	shift, and go to state 2

    term	go to state 3



state 1

    term  ->  INT_CONSTANT .   (rule 1)

    $default	reduce using rule 1 (term)



state 2

    term  ->  IDENTIFIER .   (rule 2)

    $default	reduce using rule 2 (term)



state 3

    $   	go to state 4



state 4

    $   	go to state 5



state 5

    $default	accept
